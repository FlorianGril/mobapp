- Explain how you ensure user is the right one starting the app:
I just created a password system

- How do you securely save user's data on your phone ?

- How did you hide the API url ?
I found a solution to hide base url to keep api secured with NDK. Keep base64 encoded string inside cpp file and call that from java class and decode base64.
